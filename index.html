    <h2>Air Pollution-Related Deaths by Country (1990-2017)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        This interactive world map illustrates air pollution-related deaths by country from 1990 to 2017. Initially displaying 1990
        data, users can scroll through the years to observe changes over time. Each country is color-coded to represent the death rate 
        attributed to air pollution. Darker shades indicate higher mortality rates, allowing users to explore the evolving impact of 
        air pollution on different countries. This dynamic map offers a global perspective on the changes in air pollution-related 
        deaths over nearly three decades.

        <h2>Top 5 Countries with Most and Least Deaths</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This section features two bar charts that highlight the top 5 countries with the most and the least deaths related to air 
            pollution. These charts provide a direct comparison of the countries facing the most significant challenges in managing air 
            pollution-related deaths and those that have made substantial progress in reducing their impact. The "most deaths" chart 
            serves as a call to action, emphasizing areas where interventions are urgently needed. In contrast, the "least deaths" 
            chart offers inspiration by showcasing success stories in air quality management. These visuals are instrumental in framing 
            the global context of air pollution-related deaths.
